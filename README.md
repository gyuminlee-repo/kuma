# kuma — primer design (Kuro) + NGS verification (Mame)

[한국어](README.ko.md) | **English**

📖 User guide: https://gyuminlee-repo.github.io/kuma/ — built with MkDocs (Material).

`kuma` packages two subtools into one Tauri desktop app:

- **Kuro** — *Kernel for Upstream Recombination Oligodesign.* Batch SDM primer design from Gibson Assembly templates.
- **Mame** — *Mutagenesis Assessment & Microplate Export.* Oxford Nanopore NGS verdict on which clones carry the intended mutations.

Design primers in the Kuro tab, run wet-lab + sequencing, then switch to the Mame tab to verify which clones carry the intended mutations.

![kuma overview](docs/kuro_overview.png)

Project folders keep Kuro design output and Mame verification linked across the weeks-long gap between ordering oligos and reading sequencing output. A hidden `__kuma_meta__` sheet in every Kuro-exported xlsx lets Mame auto-recognise the source project when the file is dropped back in.

## Tabs

### Kuro — SDM primer design

Given a mutation list (plain text / EVOLVEpro CSV) and a template sequence (GenBank / SnapGene), Kuro automatically designs SDM primer pairs using the overlap extension method.

- **EVOLVEpro CSV input**: Load EVOLVEpro (`variant`, `y_pred`) output CSV. Sorts by score descending, auto-selects the configured number of variants. Optional **position diversity** filter limits mutations per amino acid position (uses Grantham 1974 distance as tie-breaker when scores are within 2%). Optional **domain diversity** distributes selections across protein structural domains (auto-fetched from InterPro/Pfam or manual input). Optional **Pareto diversity** maximizes position spread via MODIFY-style fitness-diversity co-optimization. **σ-Adaptive Pool**: enter EVOLVEpro Round and Round size to automatically calibrate the candidate pool width and entropy weight based on cumulative data (K = 0.50→0.25, entropy = 0.30→0.15 across rounds 1–5+)
- **Batch mutation parsing**: Mutation list in `Q232A` format → automatic codon position calculation + WT codon validation
- **Codon strategy selection**: Choose between Min. changes (fewest base changes from WT) or Optimal (E. coli-optimized codon)
- **Overlap upstream design**: Overlap region is placed immediately upstream of the mutation codon (EVOLVEpro convention)
- **Polymerase profile selector**: Eight built-in profiles (Benchling, Taq, Phusion, Q5, Q5 SDM, KOD, DreamTaq, TAKARA_GXL), each with Tm method, salt concentration, DNA concentration, and GC range calibrated to the manufacturer manual. Custom profiles can be created via the Custom Polymerase dialog and are persisted at `~/.kuma/kuro/custom_polymerases.json`. Selecting a profile immediately updates Tm targets and GC range in the UI
- **Tm calculation**: SantaLucia 1998 nearest-neighbor model; salt/DNA/divalent conditions vary per polymerase profile (e.g. Phusion HF 222 mM monovalent, Q5 150 mM monovalent + 2000 nM DNA). Default Tm targets: Fwd 62°C, Rev 58°C, Overlap 42°C — adjustable in Advanced Options
- **Progressive Tm tolerance**: Starts at ±0.5°C for Fwd/Rev independently, expanding by ±0.5°C per step (up to ±3.0°C)
- **GC% range**: Default 40-60% (adjustable in Advanced Options). Primers outside range receive a penalty
- **Primer length limit**: Optional Fwd/Rev min/max length constraint (adjustable in Advanced Options)
- **Hairpin / Homodimer check**: Secondary structure check via primer3 calc_hairpin/calc_homodimer. Displays Tm and dG (kcal/mol)
- **AlphaFold 3D distance**: Pareto diversity uses real Cα Euclidean distance from AlphaFold DB predicted structures instead of 1D sequence position distance. Fetched automatically after UniProt accession entry; cached at `~/.kuma/kuro/embeddings/{accession}_ca.json`. Falls back to 1D position distance when the structure is unavailable
- **Benchmark framework**: Compare Kuro selection (Pareto/Domain) vs Random vs Top-N on fitness landscapes. Metrics: hit rate, mean fitness, position coverage
- **Synthesis quality score**: Oligo synthesis difficulty assessment (0-100) based on IDT/Twist guidelines. Penalizes homopolymer runs, GC-rich stretches, dinucleotide repeats, and extreme GC content
- **Sequence Map**: Collapsible SVG linear CDS map with mutation positions, domain regions, and density histogram for cluster detection
- **Column sorting**: All result columns sortable (including y_pred and synthesis score). Plate map export respects current sort order
- **Candidate comparison and swap**: Click a primer sequence to open a candidate comparison popover
- **Custom primer evaluation**: Enter a sequence directly in the candidate popover → Tm, GC%, hairpin, and off-target are calculated immediately
- **Failed mutation retry**: Click a failed mutation → adjust Tm/GC%/length/tolerance → re-design → select from candidates. The retry popover offers a one-click **Use suggestion** button that pre-fills median Tm, observed GC/length range, and tol ±5°C derived from primers that already succeeded in the same run
- **Tm tolerance setting**: User-configurable Tm tolerance ±°C (range 0.5–10.0, step 0.5, default 3.0) in Advanced Options. Cascade rescue stages add delta on top of this base value. Recommended 2–5°C
- **Position Rescue**: Mode-aware multi-stage cascade when a primer design fails.
  - **Top-N + Fill-on-failure ON** → 4-stage relaxation only (length → +GC → +mild Tm → strong), position fixed. Badges `🎯¹` length / `🎯²` +GC / `🎯³` +mild Tm / `🎯⁴` strong
  - **Pipeline + Fill-on-failure ON** → 6-stage: ① same-position alternate variant (`↻¹`) → ② different-position substitution (`↻²`) → ③–⑥ same 4-stage relaxation
  - **Fill-on-failure OFF** → failed mutations remain failed; no automatic retry or substitution runs
  - Legacy pool cascade (`↻ cascade`) and auto-relax (`⚡ relaxed`) still applied by the backend before frontend cascade
  - Stage counters displayed in Design Report
- **Auto-rescue failed mutations**: When enabled (default on), triggers the cascade above according to selection mode. When off, failed mutations remain as-is
- **Off-target detection**: Automatic detection of non-specific binding on the template sense/antisense strand
- **96-well Plate Map**: Linked Fwd/Rev plate. Multi-plate slide for >96 mutations. Synchronized with table sort order
- **Echo 525 / JANUS export**: Liquid handler mapping export as XLSX workbook. Echo: 384-well source plate layout + transfer list. JANUS: Fwd/Rev 96-well rack layout + transfer list. CSV also supported

### Mame — NGS screening verdict

Given a Kuro-exported `expected_mutations.xlsx`, a reference FASTA, and Oxford Nanopore barcode-mode consensus FASTA files, Mame produces per-barcode mutation verdicts and a 96-well Final Excel export.

- **Consensus FASTA ingest**: Barcode-mode output from Nanopore basecaller. Mock fixtures included at `tests/mame/fixtures/`.
- **6-class verdict**: Each barcode classified into one of six outcomes (exact match, partial, off-target, WT retained, no coverage, ambiguous).
- **3-replicate best pick**: Among triplicate barcodes, the best-scoring clone is selected.
- **96-well Final Excel export**: Column-major 96-well layout with verdict per well. Synchronized with Kuro's plate map ordering.
- **Single-view workbench**: Input files panel, parameter panel (mode, CDS end, cutoffs), verdict table with NB01/NB02/NB03/ALL filter, 96-well map with colorblind-safe toggle.
- **Substitution support**: Phase 1 focuses on single-residue substitutions. Deletion / insertion reserved for later.

## Selection Strategies (Kuro, EVOLVEpro mode)

When loading an EVOLVEpro scored CSV, Kuro applies the configured selection strategy to choose which mutations to design primers for. Strategies are independent checkboxes and can be combined.

| Strategy | Description | When to use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Top-N by score** | Select the top N mutations ranked by predicted fitness score (y_pred / property_value descending). N = max primers setting (default 95). | Default ranking. Use when predicted fitness is the only criterion. |
| **Position diversity** | Limit the number of mutations per amino acid position (default: 1 per position). When two variants at the same position score within 2%, the more conservative substitution (lower Grantham 1974 distance) is preferred. Applied as a pre-filter before other strategies. | Prevent over-sampling at mutational hot spots. |
| **Domain diversity** | Allocate mutation quota proportionally (by domain length) or equally across protein structural domains. Domains are auto-fetched from InterPro/Pfam via UniProt accession, or entered manually. | Ensure coverage across all functional regions. |
| **Pareto diversity** | Greedy maximin position selection: iteratively pick the mutation whose position is farthest from all already-selected positions. Maximizes spatial spread across the protein sequence. | Prevent clustering of mutations in a narrow region. Inspired by the MODIFY approach (Ding et al., *Nature Communications*, 2024). |
| **Entropy-guided** (β) | Blends per-position Shannon entropy of the y_pred distribution (weight 0.3) into the Pareto score. Positions where many mutations score similarly are prioritised. | Escape local optima. Requires Pareto diversity to be enabled. |

## Project workflow

On first launch kuma asks for a **projects root** folder (default `~/Documents/kuma`). All projects live inside as folders:

```
<projects_root>/
└── Sample_42/
    ├── kuma.project.json          # project metadata (schema v1)
    ├── design/
    │   ├── workspace.kuro.json    # Kuro workspace (same format as legacy .kuro.json)
    │   └── expected_mutations.xlsx # carries hidden __kuma_meta__ sheet
    └── analysis/
        ├── consensus/             # drop Nanopore consensus FASTAs here
        └── verdict.xlsx           # Mame output
```

The `stage` field (draft / design_complete / analyzing / done) is derived automatically from file presence. Scratch mode (open a single `.kuro.json` without creating a project) remains supported for compatibility with legacy Kuro workspaces.

## Installation

Download the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/gyuminlee-repo/kuma/releases).

- **Windows**: `kuma_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` (NSIS)
- **macOS**: `kuma_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg`
- **Linux**: `.deb` + `.AppImage`

### Developers — `pnpm setup` instead of `pnpm install` on Windows

On Windows, `pnpm install` may fail with `EACCES` / `EBUSY` on the first run when Defender or an IDE file watcher locks files in `node_modules`. Use the wrapper script:

```powershell
pnpm setup
```

`scripts/safe-install.mjs` runs `pnpm install` with `package-import-method=copy` (hardlink locks bypassed) and retries up to three times on retryable errors. macOS and Linux fall back to a plain `pnpm install` with retries.

If three attempts still fail, the script prints a guide (close IDE, add Defender exclusion, or wipe `node_modules`).

### macOS — first-launch Gatekeeper notice

kuma ships with ad-hoc code signing only (no paid Apple Developer ID). The first launch shows an "unidentified developer" warning. If the dialog instead says **"is damaged and can't be opened"**, the file picked up the quarantine bit during download — clear it once:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/kuma.app
```

Then bypass Gatekeeper one of these ways:

1. Finder → right-click (Control-click) `kuma.app` → **Open** → **Open**
2. System Settings → Privacy & Security → scroll to the kuma entry → **Open Anyway**

Subsequent launches require no further action.

## Usage

**Kuro tab**
1. **Help → Load Sample Data** to load examples, or:
2. Load a sequence file (GenBank `.gb` / SnapGene `.dna`)
3. Verify the target CDS in the Target Gene dropdown (auto-selected)
4. Enter mutations (text / EVOLVEpro CSV)
5. Select codon strategy (Min. changes / Optimal)
6. *(Optional)* Adjust Tm, GC%, length in Advanced Options
7. Click **Design Primers**
8. File → Export Excel (writes `design/expected_mutations.xlsx` with `__kuma_meta__` embedded)

**Mame tab** (after wet lab + sequencing)
1. **Help → Load Sample Data** to load examples, or:
2. Drop Nanopore consensus FASTAs into the input panel
3. Reference FASTA + `expected_mutations.xlsx` (auto-suggested if the active project has them)
4. Set CDS end / mode / cutoffs
5. **Run** → verdict table + 96-well plate map
6. **Export** → final xlsx

Dropping a Kuro-exported xlsx into Mame while a different project is active triggers the "load source project?" dialog (matched via `__kuma_meta__ → project_id`).

## Activity Data Integration (v0.2.7)

KUMA now connects the complete ALE cycle: Kuro designs primers for Round N, wet lab runs the mutations, NGS genotyping identifies which clones succeeded, activity assay measures functional improvement, and a single "Handoff" click feeds the activity data back into Kuro for Round N+1.

### Workflow

```
1. KURO Design  →  primer list for Round N mutations
2. Wet lab       →  site-directed mutagenesis + expression
3. MAME NGS      →  per-clone genotype verdict (6-class)
4. Activity assay→  plate-reader / fluorescence measurement
5. MAME Activity →  load long-format CSV; compute fold_change / log2_fc
6. EVOLVEpro export → variant + activity xlsx for next round (`[Variant, activity]` 2-column, `89W` short notation)
7. Round Handoff →  1-click: create Round N+1, load EVOLVEpro output into Kuro (short-form variants auto-converted via protein ref_seq)
8. Repeat        →  Kuro designs Round N+1 from updated scores
```

### Long Format CSV Input

The activity loader expects a **long format** CSV (or Excel) file with one measurement per row:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `plate_id` | string | Plate identifier, e.g. `P01` |
| `well_id` | string | Well address in A01–H12 format |
| `value` | float | Raw measurement value |
| `replicate_idx` | int | Replicate index (1-based); same well × same replicate_idx = one measurement |

WT wells are declared in `plate_meta.json`:

```json
{
  "plates": [
    { "plate_id": "P01", "wt_wells": ["A01", "A12", "H01", "H12"] }
  ]
}
```

Fold change and log2_fc are computed relative to the mean WT value on each plate. The log2_fc value maps directly to EVOLVEpro `y_pred`.

### Round Entity

Each ALE round is tracked as a `Round` entity in the workspace (schema v0.3). A round holds:
- `round_n`: sequential round number (1-based)
- `status`: `design` → `sequencing` → `activity` → `exported`
- `plate_meta`: WT well layout for that round
- Links to the Kuro workspace and MAME NGS results for that round

Workspace files from schema v0.2 and earlier are **not automatically migrated**. Export your design data before upgrading from v0.2.6 or earlier.

### v0.3 xlsx pipeline (v0.2.8+)

xlsx-native readers cover the inputs the wet-lab actually produces: `mutants-well position.xlsx`, Agilent GC-FID raw exports (standard / rep-batch), and EVOLVEpro xlsx files. `kuma_core/mame/activity/evolvepro_xlsx.py:detect_format` auto-dispatches.

`mame.activity.merge_for_evolvepro` (v0.2.9.0) replaces the legacy merge for EVOLVEpro export: it joins activity to genotype, runs `merge_replicates_priority` (authoritative-prefer with mismatch flag), executes the label-swap guard, and surfaces `replicate_stats` plus `export_blocked` in the response. The 5/12 demo continues to use the legacy `activity.merge` path; the v0.3 button "EVOLVEpro용 병합 (v0.3)" lives next to it in the panel and never replaces it.

The EGFP WT amino acid sequence is auto-loaded from `fixtures/egfp.fa` via BioPython translate when `ref_seq` is omitted (OQ-④ decision, v0.9.9.9). `fixtures/ispS.fa` (Populus alba ispS CDS, AB198180.1) is retained for legacy IspS rounds. No UI plumbing required for the default reference path.

## Architecture

Tauri v2 + React 19 shell with two Python sidecars (kuro-sidecar, mame-sidecar) spawned lazily on first tab activation. The Rust side owns project CRUD, config, and sidecar lifecycle. Both sidecars share `kuma_core.shared` utilities — config paths, logging, JSON-RPC error format, and `kuma_core.shared.sidecar` helpers (`JsonRpcWriter`, bounded crash-log append, private config dir, path validation).

```
+-------------------------+
| Tauri shell (React)     |
| ├─ Home / Onboarding    |
| └─ MainShell [Kuro|Mame]|
+-------------------------+
       ↓ sidecar_rpc(kind, method, params)
+----------------+   +----------------+
| kuro-sidecar   |   | mame-sidecar   |

```

## Common Frontend Standards

Kuro and Mame conform to the **Common Frontend Standards charter** (`docs/standards/common-frontend-standards.md`, v1.1 stable) — 22 categories covering recovery, observability, input guards, error UX, output persistence, settings, UI safety, accessibility, versioning, telemetry, build, reproducibility (`run.json`), long-running jobs (queue + OS notification + sleep inhibit), data integrity (input/output SHA-256, sidecar binary hash, schema dry-run migration), onboarding, local diagnostics, cross-platform, partial success, performance guardrails, citation/licensing, multi-workspace, graceful shutdown. PrimerBench applies the same charter through its Phase A-E rollout.
